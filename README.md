## Week 2: Synopsis
A normal man living in a normal city riding a motorcycle suffers a traffic accident that took him to the hospital. A strange dream: there was the smell of a swamp, there on the left side of the road where the marshes began, it smelled like war. The Aztecs had started the “flower war” in which Motecas were taken prisoners and scrified during full moon nights.
Narrated in a dual temporality, “The night face up” tells the story of a man who under the shock of an accident realizes that he is actually a Moteca being followed by the Aztecs. During a sequence of returnings to his real life he understands that his actual time is the past and he just dreamed with an incredible futuristic city where he could move around with an enormous metal insect that hummed between his legs.
